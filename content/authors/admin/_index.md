Welcome to my website! I am a third year PhD student in Finance at [Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/phd/NKoont23). I am interested in using tools from empirical IO to study the real effects of financial intermediation, and financial stability. I am also studying the environmental and social impact of corporations.

I’m originally from the Washington D.C. area. In 2018 I graduated from the University of Toronto with a BSc in math and economics, and a newfound appreciation for Canada. I enjoy trying to make sense of the world.
